## Pre-Upgrade Safety Checklist

### Power Safety (CRITICAL)
**Before touching ANY internal component:**
1. "Shut down the computer completely (not sleep, not hibernate)"
2. "Unplug the power cable from the wall outlet"
3. "For laptops: remove the battery if it's removable (slide the latch and pull out)"
4. "Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to discharge residual power"
5. "Wait 30 seconds before opening the case"

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents electric shock (rare but possible)
- Protects components from power surges
- Ensures motherboard has no active power

### Workspace Safety

**Location requirements:**
- Hard floor (wood, tile, laminate) — NO CARPET
- Stable table or desk with good lighting
- Away from liquids, food, pets, children
- Room temperature (not too hot/cold)

**What to remove before working:**
- Jewelry (rings, bracelets, watches) — can cause shorts
- Synthetic clothing (wool sweaters, fleece) — generates static
- Socks on carpet — wear shoes or bare feet on hard floor

### Static Electricity Prevention (VERY IMPORTANT)

**Why static matters:**
- Invisible shock (you won't feel it) can destroy RAM, SSD, motherboard
- Most common cause of "new component doesn't work" failures

**How to prevent:**
1. **BEST:** Wear anti-static wrist strap clipped to bare metal case
2. **GOOD:** Touch bare metal part of case every 30 seconds
3. **REQUIRED:** Work on non-carpeted surface
4. **AVOID:** Shuffling feet, synthetic fabrics, dry environments

**High-risk situations (extra care needed):**
- Winter (low humidity = more static)
- Carpeted rooms
- After walking across room (discharge before touching components)

## Component-Specific Safety

### RAM Safety

**Physical handling:**
- "Hold RAM stick by the EDGES only, never touch the gold contacts"
- "Align the notch with the slot notch BEFORE pressing down"
- "Press straight down with even pressure — do NOT rock side to side"

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT force RAM into slot (if it doesn't fit, it's backwards)
- Do NOT touch gold contacts (oils from fingers cause corrosion)
- Do NOT bend the RAM stick (permanent damage)

**If RAM won't insert:**
- Check orientation (notch alignment)
- Ensure clips are fully opened (pushed outward)
- Verify you have correct type (DDR4 won't fit DDR3 slot)

### Battery Safety

**CRITICAL WARNINGS:**
- **DO NOT puncture, bend, or apply pressure to battery** (fire/explosion risk)
- **DO NOT attempt to disassemble battery** (contains hazardous materials)
- If battery is swollen or deformed: handle with extreme care, dispose at electronics recycling center

**Safe handling procedure:**
1. "Disconnect battery cable BEFORE removing screws or clips"
2. "Lift connector straight UP, do not twist or pull at angle"
3. "Support battery weight with one hand while unscrewing with other"
4. "Place old battery on non-flammable surface away from metal objects"

**Swollen battery warning signs:**
- Trackpad or keyboard raised/bulging
- Case won't close properly
- Battery feels puffy or soft when pressed gently

**If you see a swollen battery:**
1. "STOP immediately — do not remove it yourself"
2. Power off laptop and unplug
3. Take to professional repair service or electronics recycling
4. Do NOT ship swollen battery (airline/shipping regulations)

### SSD Safety

**Physical handling:**
- "Hold by edges or label area, avoid touching gold contacts or chips"
- "For M.2: insert at 30-degree angle, then press flat and screw down"
- "Do NOT force connector (check alignment and key notch position)"

**Data safety:**
- ALWAYS back up data before replacing SSD
- Keep old SSD until you verify new one works
- Use external enclosure to access old SSD data after swap

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT touch controller chip (flat black square on SSD)
- Do NOT expose to moisture or liquids
- Do NOT drop (internal components can crack)

### WiFi Card Safety

**Antenna connector safety (VERY FRAGILE):**
- "Pull connectors straight UP, never at an angle"
- "Grip the connector itself, NOT the wire"
- "If tight, rock gently side-to-side while pulling up"

**Common mistakes:**
- Pulling on wire instead of connector (breaks connector)
- Forcing wrong antenna to wrong socket (they're labeled)
- Bending antenna wire sharply (damages cable)

**Antenna cable identification:**
- Usually labeled: MAIN/1 (white) and AUX/2 (black)
- Some laptops have 3 cables: MAIN, AUX, MIMO (various colors)
- Take PHOTO before disconnecting (for reference)

## Environmental Hazards

### Temperature
- **Ideal:** 15-25°C (59-77°F)
- **Too cold:** Components can be brittle, thermal paste hard to apply
- **Too hot:** Increased static risk, uncomfortable to work

**If components are cold (from shipping):**
- Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before installing
- Prevents condensation on components

### Humidity
- **Ideal:** 40-60% humidity
- **Too dry (<30%):** HIGH static electricity risk — extra grounding needed
- **Too humid (>70%):** Condensation risk on metal parts

### Dust & Debris
- Clean work area before starting
- Blow out dust from computer before installing new parts
- Keep food, drinks, and cigarette smoke away

## Emergency Procedures

### If you shock yourself (electric shock)
1. Immediately pull hand away
2. Check if computer was properly unplugged (it should be)
3. Do NOT continue until you verify power is off
4. If shock was significant, have someone check on you

### If component falls or drops
**RAM/SSD/WiFi card:**
1. Pick up carefully
2. Inspect for cracks, bent pins, damage
3. If no visible damage, likely OK (components are durable)
4. Test in computer before assuming it's broken

**Laptop (entire unit):**
1. Do NOT power on immediately
2. Inspect case for cracks
3. Check screen for damage
4. Let sit for 10 minutes, then test power-on
5. If it won't boot, seek professional help

### If you spill liquid on components
1. **DO NOT POWER ON**
2. Unplug immediately if not already unplugged
3. Remove battery if possible
4. Dry with lint-free cloth
5. Let air dry for 24-48 hours in warm, dry place
6. For motherboard spills: consider professional cleaning

### If you strip a screw (screw head damaged)
1. STOP trying to turn it
2. Try rubber band method: place rubber band over screw, press down and turn
3. Use screw extractor bit (available at hardware stores)
4. If in laptop case: you may proceed without that one screw if others are secure
5. If holding critical component: seek professional help

### If plastic clip breaks while opening case
1. Don't panic — usually still functional
2. Note which clip broke (may need extra care when closing)
3. Remaining clips will hold case together
4. If multiple clips break: consider aftermarket replacement case

## Disposal Safety

### Old Components

**Safe to trash (regular garbage):**
- RAM sticks (no hazardous materials)
- SSD (solid-state, no toxic elements)
- WiFi cards

**MUST recycle at electronics center:**
- Laptop batteries (lithium-ion, hazardous)
- Old hard drives (HDDs) if not reusing
- Any swollen or damaged battery (HAZARDOUS)

**Data security:**
- Wipe SSD/HDD before disposal (factory reset or disk wipe tool)
- Physically destroy if drive contains sensitive data (drill through platters for HDD)

### Packaging Materials
- Keep anti-static bags for storing old components
- Keep boxes if component is under warranty (for RMA)
- Recycle cardboard and plastic packaging

## Agent Safety Reminders

**ALWAYS mention before starting ANY procedure:**
1. "Have you powered off and unplugged the computer?"
2. "Have you removed the battery if it's removable?"
3. "Are you grounded or wearing an anti-static strap?"

**During procedure:**
- Remind about grounding every 5-10 steps
- If user mentions forcing something: STOP and verify orientation
- If user reports unusual smell, heat, or sparks: STOP immediately

**Red flags to watch for:**
- User mentions working on carpet
- User mentions computer is still plugged in
- User mentions forcing components
- User mentions damaged/swollen battery

**When in doubt:**
- Recommend seeking professional help rather than risking damage
- Better to pay for service than destroy expensive components
