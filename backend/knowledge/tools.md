## Essential Tools for Hardware Upgrades

### Screwdrivers

**Phillips Head Screwdrivers (MOST IMPORTANT)**
- **Size #0 (Small):** For M.2 SSDs, WiFi cards, small laptop screws
  - Tip diameter: ~2mm
  - Usage: "Hold screwdriver perpendicular to screw, press DOWN firmly while turning counter-clockwise to loosen"
  
- **Size #1 (Medium):** For most laptop/desktop case screws, battery screws
  - Tip diameter: ~3mm
  - Most commonly used size for general computer work
  
- **Size #2 (Large):** For desktop case panels, drive bays
  - Tip diameter: ~4mm
  - Less common in laptops

**Torx Screwdrivers (if needed)**
- **T5:** MacBooks, Microsoft Surface, some Dell laptops
- **T6:** Some HP and Lenovo models
- Star-shaped head, requires exact size match

**Magnetic vs Non-Magnetic:**
- Magnetic is SAFE for SSDs, RAM, motherboards
- Avoid magnetic near traditional hard drives (HDD) when drive is powered
- Magnetic tip helps prevent dropping tiny screws

### Anti-Static Equipment

**Anti-Static Wrist Strap (RECOMMENDED)**
- How to use:
  1. "Wrap the strap around your wrist snugly"
  2. "Clip the alligator clip to a bare metal part of the computer case (unpainted)"
  3. "Keep it attached throughout the entire upgrade"
  
**Anti-Static Mat (OPTIONAL)**
- Place under the laptop/components
- Stand on it with bare feet for extra grounding
- Not required if using wrist strap

**DIY Grounding (if no wrist strap):**
- Touch a bare metal part of the case EVERY 30 seconds
- Avoid wearing synthetic fabrics (wool, polyester)
- Work on a wooden or laminate surface, NOT carpet

### Prying Tools

**Plastic Spudger (BEST)**
- Thin, flat plastic tool for prying case panels
- Won't scratch or damage plastic cases
- Where to get: electronics repair kit, or use old credit card

**Alternatives if you don't have spudger:**
- Old credit card or gift card
- Guitar pick (thicker = better)
- Plastic putty knife (clean, no paint residue)

**NEVER use:**
- Metal flathead screwdriver (will scratch and crack plastic)
- Knife (dangerous and can slip)

### Tweezers

**When needed:**
- Picking up dropped screws
- Handling tiny WiFi antenna connectors
- Removing stuck thermal pads

**Type:** Pointed or bent-tip tweezers work best

### Lighting

**Essential for seeing tiny screws and connectors:**
- Desk lamp with adjustable arm
- Headlamp (hands-free, very useful)
- Flashlight or phone flashlight (for dark corners)

**Tip:** "Angle the light from the SIDE to see screw heads clearly"

### Cleaning Supplies

**Compressed Air (RECOMMENDED)**
- For blowing out dust before installing new components
- Hold can UPRIGHT, use short bursts
- Keep 6 inches away from components

**Isopropyl Alcohol 90%+ and Lint-Free Cloth**
- For cleaning RAM contacts, SSD connectors
- DO NOT use rubbing alcohol (too much water)
- Let dry completely before reinstalling (30 seconds)

**Microfiber Cloth**
- For wiping fingerprints off components
- Don't use paper towels (leave fibers)

## How to Use Tools Properly

### Removing Screws
1. "Select the correct screwdriver size (should fit snugly in screw head)"
2. "Press DOWN firmly with your palm while turning counter-clockwise"
3. "If screw is tight, press harder DOWN before increasing turning force"
4. "Once loose, finish unscrewing with fingers to avoid dropping"

**If screw won't budge:**
- Press DOWN harder (most important)
- Check if screwdriver is correct size
- Try tapping screwdriver handle gently with palm while turning
- Last resort: Place rubber band between screwdriver and screw for grip

### Installing Screws
1. "Start screw by hand, turning clockwise until it catches threads"
2. "Use screwdriver to tighten, but STOP when you feel resistance"
3. "Snug is enough — do NOT over-tighten (can strip threads or crack plastic)"

**How tight is 'snug'?**
- For plastic cases: "Just until screw stops turning easily"
- For metal: "Slightly tighter, but no excessive force"

### Prying Case Panels
1. "Locate the seam where top and bottom case meet"
2. "Insert spudger into gap at a corner"
3. "Twist gently to create a small opening"
4. "Slide spudger along the seam to release clips"
5. "Work slowly — if you hear cracking, STOP and find the clip location"

**Finding hidden clips:**
- Look for small notches or marks on case edge (clip locations)
- Press near the clip while prying opposite side

### Handling Components Safely

**RAM:**
- "Hold by the EDGES only, avoid touching gold contacts"
- "Align notch with slot notch before pressing down"
- "Press straight down with even pressure on both ends until clips click"

**SSD:**
- "Hold by edges or label area"
- "Insert at angle (for M.2), then press flat and screw down"
- "Do NOT touch gold connector pins"

**Battery:**
- "Lift connector straight UP, do not twist or pull at angle"
- "If connector is stuck, wiggle gently side-to-side while pulling up"

**WiFi Card:**
- "Antenna connectors are FRAGILE — pull straight up on connector, NOT the wire"
- "If tight, rock connector gently side-to-side while pulling up"

## Tool Substitutions (if you don't have the right tool)

| Need | Don't Have | Can Use Instead |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Phillips #0 | Eyeglass screwdriver (if close size) |
| Phillips #1 | Phillips #2 (if careful, not ideal) |
| Torx T5 | Small flathead (LAST RESORT, easy to strip) |
| Anti-static strap | Touch case metal every 30 seconds |
| Plastic spudger | Old credit card, guitar pick |
| Tweezers | Needle-nose pliers (gentle grip) |
| Compressed air | Soft brush (slower, less effective) |
| Isopropyl alcohol 90% | 70% if unavoidable (let dry 2+ minutes) |

## Tool Safety Tips

**Screwdriver Safety:**
- Never apply excessive force (can slip and stab you or damage components)
- Keep non-dominant hand away from screwdriver path
- Use correct size to avoid stripping screw heads

**Static Electricity Safety:**
- ALWAYS ground yourself before touching components
- Avoid shuffling feet on carpet
- Touch case metal frequently if no wrist strap

**Prying Safety:**
- Pry AWAY from yourself, not toward your body
- Use gentle force (plastic clips break easily)
- Watch for hidden screws before prying (check all edges)

**General Workspace Safety:**
- Keep liquids away from work area
- Use a bowl or magnetic tray for screws (prevent rolling off table)
- Take photos before disconnecting cables (reference for reassembly)

## Recommended Tool Kits

**Budget Option ($10-20):**
- Basic electronics repair kit with Phillips #0, #1, plastic spudgers, tweezers
- Available on Amazon, at hardware stores

**Professional Option ($30-50):**
- iFixit toolkit or similar (precision screwdrivers, metal spudgers, anti-static strap)
- Includes case for organization

**What to prioritize if buying:**
1. Phillips #0 and #1 screwdrivers (MUST HAVE)
2. Anti-static wrist strap
3. Plastic spudger
4. Compressed air

## Agent Instructions for Tool Guidance

**When user asks about tools:**
1. List ONLY the tools needed for their specific upgrade
2. Provide exact screwdriver sizes based on their device type
3. Suggest substitutions if they don't have the ideal tool
4. Remind about anti-static precautions before starting

**When user is mid-upgrade:**
- If screw won't come out: guide through proper technique (press down, correct size)
- If clip breaks: reassure and explain how to proceed (usually still functional)
- If component won't fit: check orientation and alignment before applying force
